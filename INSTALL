UDF-regexp 0.9.5dev
===================

== Configuration ==

This user defined function module relies on information only 
available in the MySQL source code, it can't be compiled if
you've only installed MySQL binary packages.

To compile this package you need to first tell configure 
where to find the MySQL source directory you want to compile
against using the --with-mysql-src configure option, e.g:

  configure --with-mysql-src=/home/username/src/mysql-5.0.37


For a full list of configure options see 

  configure --help

By default the UDF library created by this package will install
into /usr/local/lib. The mysql server may not be able to load
it from there though as this directory may not be in its
library search path. 

You may solve this by:

  - adding /usr/local/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before
    invoking the mysql server

  - changing the UDF install prefix by using either the
    --prefix or --libdir configure option so that the
    UDF library gets installed into a directory that is
    in the servers load path

  - or both of the above

== Compilation ==

Once you have successfully configured the package 
you should be able to compile it by simply typing

  make
        
== Testing ==

This package includes test cases that can be invoked using
 
  mysql test

This relies on the following mysql binaries being available
in your environments search $PATH to function as the tests
rely on the mysql server test framework:

 * mysql            - the mysql command line client
 * mysqld           - the mysql server
 * mysqladmin       - the mysql administration command line tool
 * mysql_install_db - the database server initialisation tool
 * mysqltest        - the actual test framework tool

== Installing the library ==

To install the generated UDF library you simply need to invoke

  make install

Depending on the target directories user permissions you might
need to do this as superuser though, eg. by using "sudo":

  sudo make install

Remember that the mysql server will only be able to load the
library if it is installed in a directory in its library load
path, you may modify this search path by invoking the server
with the $LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set appropriately
before starting.

== Installing the actual functions ==

To actually enable the functions provided by this UDF module
you need to make them known to the MySQL server using 
"CREATE FUNCTION" SQL commands:

Register the functions provided by this UDF module using
CREATE FUNCTION regexp_like RETURNS INTEGER SONAME "regexp.so";
CREATE FUNCTION regexp_substr RETURNS STRING SONAME "regexp.so";
CREATE FUNCTION regexp_instr RETURNS INTEGER SONAME "regexp.so";
CREATE FUNCTION regexp_replace RETURNS STRING SONAME "regexp.so";

Unregister the functions provided by this UDF module using
DROP FUNCTION regexp_like;
DROP FUNCTION regexp_substr;
DROP FUNCTION regexp_instr;
DROP FUNCTION regexp_replace;

== Changing the source ==

Changes applied to any of the files in this project may be 
overwritten by further invocations of the udf-gen tool so
you should always try to apply all necessary changes to the
XML specification file the project was generated from instead
and then regenerate the project from the spec file instead.

The udf-gen tool will only overwrite files that actually 
changed, so preserving file system time stamps of unmodified
files, to play nice with "make" and to avoid unnecessary
recompilation of source files.
